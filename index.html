        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Born in 21/08/2000, I always enjoyed playing games and messing around with computers.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I turned 16 I was faced with the decision that every teenager has to have with his education. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>
            What did I want to do?
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted to become a programmer.

        <h2> About the homepage itself</h2>
        <p>
          This homepage originally come to my mind when I was watching a video from fireship.io
          that taught how to make your own portfolio website using Three.js. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I was intrigued by the idea of using a library that uses WebGL to create a 3D environment on a browser,
          and so I started digging and learning about Three.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have to say, at this point in time I do not dominate the Three.js library, and was more playing around with it.
          However, I really enjoy how the homepage turned out, I really wanted it to have a "museum" feel and, I think I accomplished it fairly well.
        </p>
